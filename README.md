## RxAndroid-simple-example

###### A simple RxAndroid project to get you started combining Observables and Observers with API calls 

### The app consists of three buttons and three textviews :

###### The first button fetches the result of an API call and apends it to the first textview

###### The second button fetches the result of an API call every 3 seconds and apends it to the seconds textview 

###### The third button combines 2 API calls and waits until both are finished to apend the result to the third textview
